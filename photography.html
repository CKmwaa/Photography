        <h1>Photography</h1>
        <p>Photography is a way of feeling, touching, and of loving. What you have <strong>caught on film is captured forever.</strong> 
            Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.
